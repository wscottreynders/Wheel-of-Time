It would be midday, soon. Mat felt an urge to be gone, a need to hurry. It was hard keeping his pace to the young officers. Someone might wonder, if he started running, and maybe - just maybe - things had really been the way they seemed back there. Maybe Gaebril really did not suspect that he knew. Maybe. He remembered those nearly black eyes, seizing and holding like a pair of pitchfork tines through his head. Light, maybe. He forced himself to walk as if he had all the time in the world - Just a haybrain country lout staring at the rugs and the gold. Just a mudfoot whod never think anyone might put a knife in his back - until Tallanvor let him through a sallyport in one of the gates, and followed him out. The fat officer with the rats eyes was still there with the Guards, and when he saw Mat his face went red again. Before he could open his mouth, though, Tallanvor spoke. "He has delivered a letter to the Queen from the DaughterHeir. Be glad, Elber, that neither Morgase nor Gaebril knows you tried to keep it from them. Lord Gaebril was most interested in the Lady Elaynes missive." Elbers face went from red to as white as his collar. He glared once at Mat, and scuttled back along the line of guardsmen, his beady eyes peering through the bars of their faceguards as if to determine whether any of them had seen his fear. "Thank you," Mat told Tallanvor, and meant it. He had forgotten all about the fat man until he was staring him in the face again. "Fare you well, Tallanvor." He started across the oval plaza, trying not to walk too fast, and was surprised when Tallanvor walked along. Light, is he Gaebrils man, or Morgases? He was just beginning to feel an itch between his shoulder blades, as if a knife might be about to go in - He doesnt know, burn me! Gaebril doesnt suspect I know! - when the young officer finally spoke. "Did you spend long in Tar Valon? In the White Tower? Long enough to learn anything of it?" "I was only there three days," Mat said cautiously. He would have made the time less - if he could have delivered the letter without admitting ever being in Tar Valon, he would have - but he did not think the man would believe he had gone all that way to see his sister and left the same day. What under the Light is he after? "I learned what I saw in that time. Nothing of any importance. They did not guide me around and tell me things. I was only there to see Else." "You must have heard something, man. Who is Sheriam? Does talking to her in her study mean anything?" Mat shook his head vigorously to keep relief from showing on his face. "I dont know who she is," he said truthfully. Perhaps he had heard Egwene, or perhaps Nynaeve, mention the name. An Aes Sedai, maybe? "Why should it mean anything?" "I do not know," Tallanvor said softly. "There is too much I do not know. Sometimes I think she is trying to say something..." He gave Mat a sharp look. "Are you a loyal Andorman, Thom Grinwell?" "Of course I am." Light, if I say that much more often, I may start believing it. "What about you? Do you serve Morgase and Gaebril loyally?" Tallanvor gave him a look as hard as the dices mercy. "I serve Morgase, Thom Grinwell. Her, I serve to the death. Fare you well!" He turned and strode back toward the Palace with a hand gripping his sword hilt. Watching him go, Mat muttered to himself. "I will wager this" - he gave Gaebrils washleather purse a toss - "that Gaebril says the same." Whatever games they played in the Palace, he wanted no place in any of them. And he meant to make sure Egwene and the others were out of them, too. Fool women! Now I have to keep their bacon from burning instead of looking after my own! He did not start to run until the streets hid him from the Palace. When he came dashing into The Queens Blessing, nothing very much had changed in the library. Thom and the innkeeper still sat over the stones board - a different game, he saw from the positions of the stones, but no better for Gill - and the calico cat was back on the table, washing herself. A tray holding their unlit pipes and the remains of a meal for two sat near the cat, and his belongings were gone from the armchair. Each man had a wine cup at his elbow. "I will be leaving, Master Gill," he said. "You can keep the coin and take a meal out of it. Ill stay long enough to eat, but then I am on the road to Tear." is your hurry, boy?" Thom seemed to be watching the cat more than the board. "We only just arrived here." "You delivered the Lady Elaynes letter, then?" the innkeeper said eagerly. "And kept your skin whole, it seems. Did you really climb over that wall like the other young man? No, that does not matter. Did the letter soothe Morgase? Do we still have to keep tiptoeing on eggs, man?" "I suppose it soothed her," Mat said. "I think it did." He hesitated a moment, bouncing Gaebrils purse on his hand. It made a clinking sound. He had not looked to see if it really held ten gold marks; the weight was about right. "Master Gill, what can you tell me of Gaebril? Aside from the fact that he does not like Aes Sedai. You said he had not be "Why do you want to know about him?" Thom asked. "Basel, are you going to place a stone or not?" The innkeeper sighed and stuck a black stone on the board, and the gleeman shook his head. "Well, lad," Gill said, "there is not much to tell. He came out of the west during the winter. Somewhere out your way, I think. Maybe it was the Two Rivers. Ive heard the mountains mentioned." "We have no lords in the Two Rivers," Mat said. "Maybe there are some up around Baerlon. I do not know." "That could be it, lad. I had never even heard of him before, but I do not keep up with the country lords. Came while Morgase was still in Tar Valon, he did, and half the city was afraid the Tower was going to make her disappear, too. The other half did not want her back. The riots started up again, the way they did last year at the tail of winter." Mat shook his head. "I do not care about politics, Master Gill. Its Gaebril I want to know about." Thom frowned at him, and began cleaning the dottle from his longstemmed pipe with a straw. "It is Gaebril I am telling you about, lad," Gill said. "During the riots, he made himself leader of the faction supporting Morgase - got himself wounded in the fighting, I hear - and by the time she returned, he had it all suppressed. Gareth Bryne didnt like Gaebrils methods - he can be a very hard man - but Morgase was so pleased to find order restored that she named him to the post Elaida used to hold." The innkeeper stopped. Mat waited for him to go on, but he did not. Thom thumbed his pipe full of tabac and walked over to light a spill at a small lamp kept for the purpose on the mantel above the fireplace. "What else?" Mat asked. "The man has to have a reason for what he does. If he marries Morgase, would he be king when she dies? If Elayne were dead, too, I mean?" Thom choked lighting his pipe, and Gill laughed. "Andor has a queen, lad. Always a queen. If Morgase and Elayne both died - the Light send it not so! - then Morgases nearest female relative would take the throne. At least there is no question of who that is this time - a cousin, the Lady Dyelin - not like the Succession, after Tigraine vanished. It took a year before Morgase sat on the Lion Throne, then. Dyelin could keep Gaebril as her advisor, or marry him to cement the line - though she would not likely do that unless Morgase had had a child by him - but he would be the Prince Consort even then . No more than that. Thank the Light, Morgase is a young woman, yet. And Elayne is healthy. Light! The letter did not say she is ill, did it?" "She is well." For now, at least. "Isnt there anything else you can tell me about him? You do not seem to like him. Why?" The innkeeper frowned in thought, and scratched his chin, and shook his head. "I suppose I would not like him marrying Morgase, but I do not truly know why. Hes said to be a fine man; the nobles all look to him. I do not like most of the men hes brought into the Guards. Too much has changed since he came, but I cannot lay it all at his door. There just seem to be too many people muttering in corners since he came. You would think we were all Cairhienin, the way they were before this civil war, all plotting and trying to find advantage. I keep having bad dreams since Gaebril came, and I am not the only one. Fool thing to worry about, dreams. It is probably only worry about Elayne, and what Morgase means to do concerning the White Tower, and people acting like Cairhienin. I just do not know. Why are you asking all these questions about Lord Gaebril?" "Because he wants to kill Elayne," Mat said, "and Egwene and Nynaeve with her." There was nothing useful in what Gill had told him that he could see. Burn me, I dont have to know why he wants them dead. I just have to stop it. Both men were staring at him again. As if he were mad. Again. "Are you coming down sick again?" Gill said suspiciously. "I remember you staring crossways at everyone the last time. Its either that, or else you think this is some sort of prank. You have the look of a prankster to me. If that is it, its a nasty one!" Mat grimaced. "It is no bloody prank. I overheard him telling some man called Comar to cut Elaynes head off. And Egwenes and Nynaeves while he was about it. A big man, with a white stripe in his beard." "That does sound like Lord Comar," Gill said slowly. "He was a fine soldier, but it is said he left the Guard over some matter of weighted dice. Not that anyone says it to his face; Comar was one of the best blades in the Guards. You really mean it, dont you?" "I think he does, Basel," Thom said. "I very much think he does." "The Light shine on us! What did Morgase say? You did tell her, didnt you? The Light burn you, you did tell her!" "Of course, I did," Mat said bitterly. "With Gaebril standing right there, and her gazing at him like a lovesick lapdog! I said, I may be a simple village man who just climbed over your wall half an hour past, but I already happen to know your trusted advisor there, the one you seem to be in love with, intends to murder your daughter. Light, man, shed have cut my head off!" "She might have at that." Thom stared into the elaborate carvings on the bowl of his pipe and tugged one mustache. "Her temper was ever as sudden as lightning, and twice as dangerous." "You know it better than most, Thom," Gill said absently. Staring at nothing, he scrubbed both hands through his graying hair. "There has to be something I can do. I havent held a sword since the Aiel War, but... Well, that would do no good. Get myself killed and do nothing by it. But I must do something!" "Rumor." Thom rubbed the side of his nose; he seemed to be studying the stones board and talking to himself. "No one can keep rumors from reaching Morgases ears, and if she hears it strongly enough, she will start to wonder. Rumor is the voice of the people, and the voice of the people often speaks truth. Morgase knows that. There is not a man alive I would back against her in the Game. Love or no love, once Morgase starts examining Gaebril closely, hell not be able to hide as much as his childhood scars from her. And if she learns he means harm to Elayne" - he placed a stone on the board; it seemed an odd placement at first glance, but Mat saw that in three more moves, a third of Gills stones would be trapped - "Lord Gaebril will have a most "You and your Game of Houses," Gill muttered. "Still, it might work. "A sudden smile appeared on his face. "I even know who to tell to start it. All I need do is mention to Gilda that I dreamed it, and in three days shell have told serving girls in half the New City that it is a fact. She is the greatest gossip the Creator ever made." "Just be certain it cannot be traced back to you, Basel." "No fear of that, Thom. Why a week ago, a man told me one of my own bad dreams as a thing hed heard from somebody whod had it from someone else. Gilda must have eavesdropped on me telling it to Coline, but when I asked, he gave me a string of names that led all the way to the other side of Caemlyn and vanished. Why, I actually went over there and found the last man, just out of curiosity to see how many mouths had passed it, and he claimed it was his very own dream. No fear, Thom." Mat did not really care what they did with their rumors - no rumors would help Egwene or the others - but one thing puzzled him. "Thom, you seem to be taking this all very calmly. I thought Morgase was the great love of your life." The gleeman stared into the bowl of his pipe again. "Mat, a very wise woman once told me that time would heal my wounds, that time smoothed everything over. I didnt believe her. Only she was right." "You mean you do not love Morgase anymore." "Boy, it has been fifteen years since I left Caemlyn a half step ahead of the headsmans axe, with the ink of Morgases signature still wet on the warrant. Sitting here listening to Basel natter on" - Gill protested, and Thom raised his voice - "natter on, I say, about Morgase and Gaebril, and how they might marry, I realized the passion faded a long time gone. Oh, I suppose I am still fond of her, perhaps I even love her a little, but it is not a grand passion anymore." "And here I half thought youd go running up to the Palace to warn her." He laughed, and was surprised when Thom joined him. "I am not so big a fool as that, boy. Any fool knows men and women think differently at times, but the biggest difference is this. Men forget, but never forgive; women forgive, but never forget. Morgase might kiss my cheek and give me a cup of wine and say how she has missed me. And then she might just let the Guards haul me off to prison and the headsman. No. Morgase is one of the most capable women Ive ever known, and that is saying something. I could almost pity Gaebril once she learns what he is up to. Tear, you say? Is there any chance of you waiting until tomorrow to leave? I could use a nights sleep." "I mean to be as far toward Tear as I can before nightfall." Mat blinked. "Do you mean to come with me? I thought you meant to stay here." "Did you not just hear me say I had decided not to have my head cut off? Tear sounds a safer place to me than Caemlyn, and suddenly that does not seem so bad. Besides, I like those girls." A knife appeared in his hand and was as suddenly gone again. "Id not like anything to happen to them. But if you mean to reach Tear quickly, its Aringill you want. A fast boat will have us there days sooner than horses, even if we rode them to death. And I dont say it just because my bottom has already taken on the shape of a saddle." "Aringill, then. As long as its fast." "Well," Gill said, "I suppose if you are leaving, lad, I had better see about getting you that meal." He pushed back his chair and started for the door. "Hold this for me, Master Gill," Mat said, and tossed him the washleather purse. "Whats this, lad? Coin?" "Stakes. Gaebril doesnt know it, but he and I have a wager." The cat jumped down as Mat picked up the wooden dice cup and spun the dice out on the table. Five sixes. "And I always win."
