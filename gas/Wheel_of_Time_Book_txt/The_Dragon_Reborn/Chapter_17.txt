She did not look old, yet Egwene could never imagine Elaida as having been young. Except for the most formal occasions, few Aes Sedai wore the vineembroidered shawl with the white teardrop Flame of Tar Valon large on the wearers back, but Elaida wore hers, the long red fringe announcing her Ajah. Red slashed her dress of creamcolored silk, too, and red slippers peeked under the edge of her skirts as she moved into the room. Her dark eyes watched them as a birds eyes watched worms. "So all of you are together. Somehow, that does not surprise me." Her voice made no more pretense than her bearing did; she was a woman of power, and ready to wield it if she decided it was necessary, a woman who knew more than those she spoke to. It was much the same for a queen as for a novice. "Forgive me, Elaida Sedai," Nynaeve said, dropping another curtsy, "but I was about to go out. I have much to catch up in my studies. If you will forgive -" "Your studies can wait," Elaida said. "They have waited long enough already, after all." She plucked the cloth bag out of Nynaeves hands and undid the strings, but after one glance inside, she tossed it on the floor. "Herbs. You are not a village Wisdom any longer, child. Trying to hold on to the past will only hold you back." "Elaida Sedai," Elayne said, "I -" "Be silent, novice." Elaidas voice was cold and soft, as silk wrapped around steel is soft. "You may have broken a bond between Tar Valon and Caemlyn that has lasted three thousand years. You will speak when spoken to." Elaynes eyes examined the floor in front of her toes. Spots of color burned in her cheeks. Guilt, or a Ignoring them all, Elaida sat down in one of the chairs, carefully arranging her skirts. She made no gesture for the rest of them to sit. Nynaeves face tightened, and she began giving sharp little tugs to her braid. Egwene hoped she would keep her temper well enough not to take the other chair without permission. When Elaida had settled herself to her own satisfaction, she studied them for a time in silence, her face unreadable. At last she said, "Did you know that we have the Black Ajah among us?" Egwene exchanged startled glances with Nynaeve and Elayne. "We were told," Nynaeve said cautiously. "Elaida Sedai," she added after a pause. Elaida arched an eyebrow. "Yes. I thought that you might know of it." Egwene gave a start at her tone, implying so much more than it said, and Nynaeve opened her mouth angrily, but the Aes Sedais flat stare stilled tongues. "The two of you," Elaida went on in a casual tone, "vanish, taking with you the DaughterHeir of Andor - the girl who may become Queen of Andor one day, if I do not strip off her hide and sell it to a glove maker - vanish without permission, without a word, without a trace." "I was not carried off," Elayne said to the floor. "I went of my own will." "Will you obey me, child?" A glow surrounded Elaida. The Aes Sedais glare was fixed on Elayne. "Must I teach you, here and now?" Elayne raised her head, and there was no mistaking what was in her face. Anger. For a long moment she met Elaidas stare. Egwenes fingernails dug into her palms. It was maddening. She, or Elayne, or Nynaeve, could destroy Elaida where she sat. If they caught Elaida by surprise, at least; she was fully trained, after all. And if we do anything but take whatever she wants to feed us, we throw away everything. Dont throw it away now, Elayne. Elaynes head dropped. "Forgive me, Elaida Sedai," she mumbled. "I - forgot myself " The glow winked out of existence, and Elaida sniffed audibly. "You have learned bad habits, wherever these two took you. You cannot afford bad habits, child. You will be the first Queen of Andor ever to be Aes Sedai. The first queen anywhere to be Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. You will be one of the strongest of us since the Breaking of the World, perhaps strong enough to be the first ruler since the Breaking to openly tell the world she is Aes Sedai. Do not risk all of that, child, because you can still lose it all. I have invested too much time to see that. Do you understand me?" "I think so, Elaida Sedai," Elayne said. She sounded as if she did not understand at all. No more did Egwene. Elaida abandoned the subject. "You may be in grave danger. All three of you. You disappear and return, and in the interval, Liandrin and her... companions leave us. There will inevitably be comparisons. We are sure Liandrin and those who went with her are Darkfriends. Black Ajah. I would not see the same charge leveled at Elayne, and to protect her, it seems I must protect all of you. Tell me why you ran away, and what you have been doing these months, and I will do what I can for you." Her eyes fastened on Egwene like grappling hooks. Egwene floundered for an answer that the Aes Sedai would accept. It was said that Elaida could hear a lie, sometimes. "It... it was Mat. He is very sick." She tried to choose her words carefully, to say nothing that was not true, yet give an impression far from truth. Aes Sedai do it all the time. "We went to... We brought him back to be Healed. If we hadnt, he would die. The Amyrlin is going to Heal him." I hope. She made herself continue to meet the Red Aes Sedais gaze, willed herself not to shift her feet guiltily. From Elaidas face, there was no way to tell whether she believed a word. "That is enough, Egwene," Nynaeve said. Elaidas penetrating look shifted to her, but she gave no sign of being affected by it. She met the Aes Sedais eyes without blinking. "Forgive me for interrupting, Elaida Sedai," she said smoothly, "but the Amyrlin Seat said our transgressions were to be put behind us and forgotten. As part of making a new beginning, we are not even to speak of them. The Amyrlin said it should be as if they never happened." "She said that, did she?" Still nothing in Elaidas voice or on her face told whether she believed or not. "Interesting. You can hardly forget entirely when your punishment has been announced to the entire Tower. Unprecedented, that. Unheard of, for less than stilling. I can see why you are eager to put it all behind you . I understand you are to be raised to the Accepted, Elayne. And Egwene. That is hardly punishment." Elayne glanced at the Aes Sedai as though for permission to speak. "The Mother said we were ready," she said. A touch of defiance entered her voice. "I have learned, Elaida Sedai, and grown. She would not have named me to be raised if I had not." "Learned," Elaida said musingly. "And grown. Perhaps you have." There was no hint in her tone whether she thought this was good. Her gaze shifted back to Egwene and Nynaeve, searching. "You returned with this Mat, a youth from your village. There was another young man from your village. Rand alThor." Egwene felt as if an icy hand had suddenly gripped her stomach. "I hope he is well," Nynaeve said levelly, but her hand was a fist gripping her braid. "We have not seen him in some time." "An interesting young man." Elaida studied them as she spoke. "I met him only once, but I found him - most interesting. I believe he must be taveren. Yes. The answers to many questions may rest in him. This Emonds Field of yours must be an unusual place to produce the two of you. And Rand alThor." "It is just a village," Nynaeve said. "Just a village like any other." "Yes. Of course." Elaida smiled, a cold quirk of her lips that twisted Egwenes stomach. "Tell me about him. The Amyrlin has not commanded you to be silent about him also, has she?" her braid a tug. Elayne studied the carpet as if something important were hidden in it, and Egwene wracked her brain for an answer. She can hear lies, they say. Light, if she can really hear a lie... The moment stretched on, until finally Nynaeve opened her mouth. At that instant the door opened again. Sheriam regarded the room with a measure of surprise. "It is well I find you here, Elayne. I want all three of you. I had not expect Elaida stood, arranging her shawl. "We are all curious about these girls. Why they ran away. What adventures they had while gone. They say the Mother has commanded them not to speak of it." "As well not to," Sheriam said. "They are to be punished, and that should be an end to it. I have always felt that when punishment is done, the fault that caused it should be erased." For a long moment the two Aes Sedai stood looking at each other, no expression on either smooth face. Then Elaida said, "Of course. Perhaps I will speak to them another time. About other matters." The look she gave to the three women in white seemed to Egwene to carry a warning, and then she was slipping past Sheriam. Holding the door open, the Mistress of Novices watched the other Aes Sedai go down the gallery. Her face was still unreadable. Egwene let out a long breath, and heard echoes from Nynaeve and Elayne. "She threatened me," Elayne said incredulously, and half to herself. "She threatened me with stilling, if I dont stop being - willful!" "You mistook her," Sheriam said. "If being willful were a stilling offense, the list of the stilled would have more names on it than you could learn. Few meek women ever achieve the ring and the shawl. That is not to say, of course, that you must not learn to act meekly when it is required.""Yes, Sheriam Sedai," they all three said almost as one, and Sheriam smiled. "You see? You can give the appearance of meekness, at least. And you will have plenty of opportunity to practice before you earn your way back into the Amyrlins good graces. And mine. Mine will be harder to achieve." "Yes, Sheriam Sedai," Egwene said, but this time only Elayne spoke with her. Nynaeve said, "What of... the body, Sheriam Sedai? The... the Soulless? Have you discovered who killed him? Or why he entered the Tower?" Sheriams mouth tightened. "You take one step forward, Nynaeve, and then a step back. Since from Elaynes lack of surprise, you have obviously told her of it - after I told you not to speak of the matter! - then there are exactly seven people in the Tower who know a man was killed today in the novices quarters, and two of them are men who know no more than that. Except that they are to keep their mouths shut. If an order from the Mistress of Novices carries no weight with you - and if that is so, I will correct you - perhaps you will obey one from the Amyrlin Seat. You are to speak of this to no one except the Mother or me. The Amyrlin will not have more rumors piled on those we must already contend with. Do I make myself clear?" The firmness of her voice produced a chorus of "Yes, Sheriam Sedai" - but Nynaeve refused to stop at that. "Seven, you said, Sheriam Sedai. Plus whoever killed him. And maybe they had help getting into the Tower." "That is no concern of yours." Sheriams level gaze included them all. "I will ask whatever questions must be asked about this man. You will forget you know anything at all about a dead man. If I discover you are doing anything else... Well, there are worse things than scrubbing pots to occupy your attention. And I will not accept any excuses. Do I hear any more questions?" "No, Sheriam Sedai." This time, Nynaeve joined in, to Egwenes relief. Not that she felt very much relief. Sheriams watchful eye would make it doubly hard to carry out a search for the Black Ajah. For a moment she felt like laughing hysterically. If the Black Ajah doesnt catch us, Sheriam will. The urge to laugh vanished. If Sheriam isnt Black Ajah herself. She wished she could make that thought go away. Sheriam nodded. "Very well, then. You will come with me." "To where?" Nynaeve asked, and added, "Sheriam Sedai," only an instant before the Aes Sedais eyes narrowed. "Have you forgotten," Sheriam said in a tight voice, "that in the Tower, Healing is always done in the presence of those who bring their sick to us?" Egwene thought that the Mistress of Novicess stock of patience with them was about used up, but before she could stop herself, she burst out, "Then she is going to Heal him!" "The Amyrlin Seat herself, among others, will see to him." Sheriams face held no more expression than her voice. "Did you have reason to doubt it?" Egwene could only shake her head. "Then you waste your friends life standing here. The Amyrlin Seat is not to be kept waiting." Yet despite her words, Egwene had the feeling the Aes Sedai was in no hurry at all.
