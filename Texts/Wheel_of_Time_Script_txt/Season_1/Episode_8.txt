[bell chiming]Latra Posae Decume: No.Lews Therin Telamon: Latra, we--Latra: You have presented your case and you have our answer.Lews Therin: So, that's it then? You would break the Aes Sedai in two? Men against women?Latra: It's you who breaks us.: You can't stop me.: [baby crying]: I can't.Lews Therin: We have a chance, here to do something that's never been done before-- to cage the Dark One, to stop His influence from touching this world ever again.Latra: When you and I became Aes Sedai, we swore an oath to serve all. What you plan to do? It serves only your pride.: You're wrong.Latra: You expose the very source of the One Power to Him. If He touches and corrupts it, your Power will be out of control. It will run unchecked. You and your men could throw us back a thousand years or more.Lews Therin: If you help us, we won't fail.Latra: We will remain, to pick up the pieces as best we can if you do.: [scoffs softly]Latra: What's wrong?Lews Therin: To think, the fate of the world was decided in a nursery.Latra: Nothing was decided here. The decision rests solely with you, when you face Him. This is just an imperfect, overwhelmed woman trying to remind her old friend that he's not invincible.: [baby continues crying]Latra: Light be with you, Lews Therin Telamon, Dragon Reborn.Latra: And you, Latra Posae Decume, Tamyrlin Seat, Watcher of the Flame.: [shushing]Lews Therin: Sweetheart. Sweetheart, daddy's here. Today I make the world safe for you.Rand: What happened to him?Moiraine: Boys from the Borderlands sometimes like to test themselves against the Blight. And they usually come up wanting. Don't touch him. Don't touch anything here. The Blight is a rot which spreads from the Dark One's prison and consumes everything in its path. Including young men in way over their heads.: [faint roaring in distance]: [bell tolling]: [door opens]: [crying]Perrin: You know we can't go. We have no idea where they are, where they're going. Only Moiraine does. We'll die in the Blight.Egwene: [sobbing] I love him, Perrin. [sniffles]Perrin: So do I.Egwene: Are we all right?Perrin: We'll always be all right.: [footsteps crunching]Moiraine: Good. We're getting closer.  We can rest here. For half an hour, no more.Rand: What are those?Moiraine: The Seven Towers of Malkier.Rand: Malkier? That's where Lan said he was born. It looks like it's been that way a thousand years.Moiraine: Forty at most. Three years ago, it was miles from Tarwin's Gap. It's just another sign that the Dark One's strength is building.Rand: Was it hard?Moiraine: What?Rand: To leave him behind.Moiraine: Here. Have some of that. You need to keep up your strength.: [birds chirping]: [chatter in distance]: Are you all right?: Can you feel anything through the bond?Lan: She doesn't want to be followed.  Not to what she's facing now.Nynaeve: After the Trolloc attack in the Two Rivers, when I followed you... It wasn't you who I tracked. It was her. She has a tell. I can show you how.Lan: You would let me go without you?Nynaeve: You bring him back.: ♪ ♪Lan: You are a remarkable woman, Wisdom.Nynaeve: A Wisdom never weds. But if I go to Tar Valon, it may be I'll be something other than a Wisdom.Lan: I will hate the man you choose. Because he is not me. And I will love him if he makes you smile. You are as beautiful as the sunrise. You are as fierce as a warrior. You are a lioness, Wisdom.: [sighs]Lan: Tell me how to find them.Moiraine: What? What did you dream? Dreams have great meaning, especially here, so close to his touch.Rand: It was the Dark One. He knows where we are. He's coming.: [gasps]: [panting]: [distorted] I wouldn't have expected it would be you.: [grunts]: [squelching]The Man: [normal voice] There. That's better. Hard to have a real conversation otherwise. You look nothing like him. But still, you're him. I see it behind your eyes.The Man: So what's your plan, Lews Therin? You have one, right?Rand: No, this is a dream.The Man: Does it matter? Whether you're asleep or awake? I mean, either way, here we are, finally having a conversation once again. Sit down. It's pathetic, you know. Coming for me with a single Aes Sedai at your side. The last time, you... you came with 99 companions, far stronger than her, and... and still you failed. Have you even touched the Power before? Do you have any idea what you're doing?The Man: Ooh. A heron-marked blade. Where did you get that?Rand: From my father.The Man: [laughing] Your father has been dead a long time, boy. Oh, you mean... you mean that shepherd in the Two Rivers? What's his name again? Tam? Tam al'Thor, right? [chuckles] Oh, you really do think he's your father. That's... that's sweet in a way. Who would've thought the Dragon Reborn would be a fool? Every turning has its little surprises, I suppose.Rand: This is a dream.The Man: Stubborn as ever, Lews. Come. Put down the sword. Let me tell you what those women never would about what it means to be the Dragon.Moiraine: What did he say to you?Rand: I don't believe a word he said.Rand: When we get there, what's our plan?Moiraine: What did he say to you in the dream?Rand: No, this is about you. You always have a plan within a plan within a plan. Don't try to convince me that for this you've got nothing.Moiraine: This is a sa'angreal. It was made before the Breaking of the World, created from the One Power itself. Thousands of male channelers put the entirety of their strength into this one small object. And when you channel into it, it'll increase your power a hundredfold.Rand: And what do I do with that power?Moiraine: You put him back where he belongs, where his touch can't reach the Earth for another 3,000 years.Rand: Just that.Rand: You thought it would be Egwene. Didn't you? You taught her to channel. You introduced her to your Amyrlin Seat. You thought it was her. ... So did I.: [wind whistling softly]: What do you hear?Nynaeve: Nothing. Ever since the day I channeled, I hear nothing. Do you hear anything?: [wind grows louder]: [faint, distant screaming]: [screaming grows louder]: [fierce roaring]: What is it?Egwene: Same thing we heard on Bel Tine. Something wrong. But if that was a whisper, this is a scream.: [footsteps sloshing]: [branches creaking]: [nearby snarling]: [chuckles softly]Rand: Will you teach me how to channel?Moiraine: I can't. Every time you touch the Source, it'll take you closer and closer to the madness.Rand: Oh, do you think I care what happens to me after today?Moiraine: When you face him, the fear, the adrenaline-- you'll embrace the One Power whether you want to or not.Rand: What if I don't?Moiraine: You will.Rand: How can you be so sure?Moiraine: There was an Aes Sedai at the White Tower when I was a novice. She was everything that I wanted to be. She was strong, controlled, precise. She... she was terrifying. And she took a liking to me. She said she wanted to help make me everything that she thought I could be. And I was having... I was having trouble channeling. And she came to my room at night, alone... and she beat me with the One Power. Lashes of air and fire. And she wouldn't stop until the pain and the fear was so overwhelming that I grabbed the Power myself and I stopped her. Without even thinking about it, without even trying. I promise you, when your life's on the line, the Power will be there. And when it comes to you, you channel it into the sa'angreal.Min: Agee, you're gonna want to move.Egwene: We need some answers.Agee: Excuse me, sir.Min: Fancy a drink first?Perrin: It's not even noon yet.Min: You're the one in the bar.Egwene: What did you tell Moiraine about Rand?Min: People's secrets are their business, no one else's.Egwene: Can't you at least tell us if he's going to be all right?Min: It's not how it works, I'm afraid. All I know is that everything I've ever seen, the best things and the worst... they've all come true eventually.: [skin burning]: [pained grunting]: [men screaming]: [horn blaring in distance]: [urgent chatter]: [bell clanging outside]: [roaring in distance]Rand: What is that?: [roaring continues]Moiraine: Well, he knows we're coming.Rand: But Egwene. And Perrin, Nynaeve, they're in the city...Moiraine: The only way to stop that army is to stop the Dark One himself.: I told you their numbers were building.: How many?: Our men in the fortress have spotted at least 60 Fades amongst them, so there must be at least 5,000 to 10,000.: And there are still more Trollocs pouring out of the Blight and gathering at the mouth of Tarwin's Gap.: I'll bloody skin them myself and burn their goat-kissing hides.: Are they coming for the city?: Not yet.: But two ropes were cut on the drawbridge.: There are Darkfriends inside our walls.Agelmar: We need to send our entire force to support the men in the Gap's fortress.: The Gap won't hold.: I'll ready my personal guard and move to the fortress.: You know what you need to do.: The Gap will not hold.Rand: This is it, isn't it? I know this place.Rand: You said that whoever goes with the Dragon to the Eye of the World will die there. Does that include you?Rand: Stay.: Do you remember the first time Father let us help him with his armor?Agelmar: A thousand Trollocs in the Gap.: Seemed like there was no chance he would stop them.: That armor kept him safe through hundreds of battles.: And his father through hundreds more.: And his father...Agelmar: I need my armor today, not theirs.: You should stay in the city.: The Gap cannot hold against that force.: It simply cannot.: The men will hold the Gap.: And if we cannot, the women will hold the city.: It is what our family has done for a thousand years.Amalisa: What we face today is five times the size of what's come before.: We cannot...: You're right, sister.: You were right all along.: We should have asked the White Tower for aid long ago.: Today, Tarwin's Gap will fall.: And then this city will fall after, no matter what we do.: And then His armies will pour through the Gap and raze every city we know the name of and more we don't.: The whole world will burn.: The Dark One is waking.: Tarmon Gai'don is here.: The Last Battle.: But it is not ours to win, you and I.: We will slow his forces as much as we can, while our messengers fly in every direction with the Light's speed at their heels.: Let us hope we buy the women and men of this world enough time to stand a fighting chance.: I will not let our city fall.: [rocks clattering softly]: [water dripping]Rand: What was this place?Moiraine: We have no idea. Every record of its existence was purged from the White Tower's libraries by Darkfriends. You said you remember this place. What do you remember?Rand: The pieces don't... fit together. It's like... a puzzle. Or a dream. Every time I grab onto something, it just slips away.Rand: I fought someone here. The Dark One. But it looked like a man.: It was here.: In the center.: There was a symbol.: This symbol.: The Eye.: [gasps softly]: [woman and girl laughing]: [woman speaking playfully]: [laughing continues]: [laughs] Oh!: [Egwene speaking playfully]Rand: Egwene?Egwene: You finished already?Rand: What? Finished?Egwene: With the lantern. You know Mat's never gonna find time to make a proper one for Joiya, - no matter how many times he says he will.: [Egwene laughs]: Joiya.Egwene: You take her for a minute. [sighs]: I'll finish it.: She'll only walk for you anyway.: [Joiya babbling happily]: And it's a beautiful day.Moiraine: Rand.The Man: What did you think would happen?The Man: [laughing] Must be an awful feeling. To know the One Power is there, just at the end of your fingertips... but you can't quite touch it.: [weapons clanging]: [horses neighing]Agelmar: For the Light! And Shienar!: [men yelling wildly]Amalisa: Keep the gates open another hour to allow foreigners to leave, but every Shienaran woman or child stays to fight for our city.: Take whatever you need from the Royal Armory.: We leave nothing in reserve.: I need archers on the North Wall, women ready to burn the bridges when the time comes.: And light every torch in the city.: There'll be no shadows to hide a Fade tonight.: Spread word through the city: Any woman who can channel the One Power, be it even a trickle, I need them.: Light protect Fal Dara! The city that has never fallen!crowd: The city that has never fallen!: [grunting]: We have to get out of here.: To where?: To Rand? We don't even know where he is.Nynaeve: They're going to close the gates, and then we're trapped in here.: We can't just leave them.: What? What is it?Loial: They're calling for all women who can channel. To help defend the city.Nynaeve: I left the Two Rivers to bring the four of you home. I've already lost Mat and Rand. I can't lose you, too.: [horn blaring]: Let them buy every step they take with blood.: [men shout in unison]: Fire on my command.: Ready!: May the last embrace of the mother welcome you home.: [screeching]: Aim!: Fire!: [squealing]: [men shouting]Amalisa: Moiraine's two. I shouldn't be surprised.Nynaeve: We're no one's but our own.Perrin: How can we just sit here while everyone else is willing to fight?Loial: I'm standing. You might...Perrin: This is bullshit! All of it! The Way of the Leaf. What are we supposed to do, just watch our friends die?!Loial: Of course not. There are always options other than violence.Perrin: What? What can we do?Loial: In my own experience, if you want to help but don't know how, all you need to do is ask.: [Joiya cooing softly]Egwene: What is it? What's wrong?Rand: How long have we lived here?Egwene: Since we got back from the Eye. What's wrong with you?Rand: I thought you wanted to go to the White Tower to...Egwene: No, this is where I want to be. You all right?Rand: Do you remember... when we were little? We packed a bag and said we were running away. I don't even remember why-- something your mum had said. But it was just you and me. We got as far as the Waterwood. But it started raining, it was getting dark, and we stopped. And we spent the night there. Under a little tree. And in the morning, we weren't as mad as we'd been before, so we went back home. But before we left, we carved something into that tree. Do you remember what it was?: [Egwene sighs softly]Egwene: "Our place. For this life and the next. Forever."Rand: It's you.Rand: It's really you.: [Egwene chuckles]Egwene: Of course it is.: [soft whoosh]The Man: You see? It is her. Or a version of what could be her.Rand: What do you mean?The Man: Did no one tell you what you can do? About the Power inside you? You can remake the world in your image. Make it whatever you want it to be. This, if you want. I can show you how.The Man: I wonder what he'll choose. Light or Dark?Moiraine: You didn't think I'd come here without knowing what I was walking into, did you? We both know you can't escape this place without his help. And if he doesn't choose the Light... I'll choose for him.: [men straining]Armswoman Hallway: Lord Yakota.: I said we were not to be disturbed.: Glory to the Builders.Perrin: What can we do?: [Trollocs roaring, squealing]Amalisa: Light help you, brother.: [roaring]: [roars]: [yells]The Man: The world... it all feels so stable. The truth is it's not. Everything that means anything can be gone in an instant.Rand: No. No.The Man: I thought you didn't think she was real.Rand: Stop it!: [whispers] What?Rand: How do I make it real?The Man: Simple. More simple than you could imagine.Padan Fain: The kingfisher flashes above the pond.Armswoman Rose: Who gave you those words?: [screeches]: [blade slices]: There it is.Uno: The Horn of bloody Valere, lad. To be blown at the Last Battle.: To call the Pattern's greatest heroes to stand at our side.Perrin: Well, then let's hurry up and get it.: We're not going to use it.: It's for the Dragon.: Without it, they won't stand a chance.: They're through.: There must be 10,000, 20.: Does this mean Rand...: Did he fail?Amalisa: I need you to open yourselves to me. When I reach out to you with the One Power, accept it. Let me in.Amalisa: Are you ready?Amalisa: By the Light... the Power.: [women grunting]Perrin: Hey. Stop.The Man: Look into her eyes, and empty yourself of everything. Of anger, of fear, of sadness. Turn it all into want. Want that little girl so much she simply is. Yes. There. Now release everything, everything inside you. Let the Power flow through you like you're an open sieve. Don't fight it.The Man: Well... he's channeling. And you don't even know what he's channeling to do. To break my chains or to strengthen them.: [Trollocs roaring]Amalisa: I need more!: [women grunting, gasping]: [straining]: [screeching in distance]: Make her yours.: She already was.: She already is.Amalisa: Hold.: Hold!: Light protect Fal Dara, the city that has never fallen!: [women shout]: [thunder booming]: [Trollocs squealing]The Man: What are you doing? No. You can remake the world in your image, boy. Make it what you want.Rand: What about what she wants? And as much as I love her, as much as I want this, I know that she doesn't.The Man: No.Rand: That woman... who doesn't care about being a Wisdom... being an Aes Sedai... that's not the woman I love.: [whooshing]: [whooshing grows louder]: [explosion]: [grunts, gasps]: [Rand panting]Moiraine: What happened?Rand: I did it.: [thunder rumbling in distance]: [squeaking]: [screech in distance]: Loial!: [men grunting, swords clanging in distance]: [snarls]: Padan Fain.: [grunts, panting]: [blade stabs]: [Loial grunts]: Enough!: We stopped them!Amalisa: I can't let go!: [groaning]Egwene: Nynaeve! I'm burning!: You have to stop! You're gonna kill us!Amalisa: I can feel the whole world, every breath and gust and stone and life. Everything.: [screams]Nynaeve: To be a woman is to be always alone and never alone.Egwene: No, no, Nynaeve. What are you doing? No.Nynaeve: Feel your braid and know that we all stood before you.Egwene: No.Nynaeve: We all stand with you.Egwene: No!: [thunder rumbling]: [breath trembles softly]: [crying softly]: [sobbing loudly]Fain: You think it's a coincidence that I came to the Two Rivers every Bel Tine?: That I'd drag myself up to that sheep shit patch of nothing just to sell lanterns?: Why?Fain: You're ta'veren. All five of you, focal points for the Wheel. Usually there's only one, maybe two in a generation, but... five of you in one village. That's what Moiraine saw. What my Lord saw.: [sobbing softly]: Come on.Fain: That's why we sent the Trollocs, not to kill you. To bring you to him. We need the Dark. We need balance. Balance means that you will turn to the Shadow, some of you. Maybe all of you.Moiraine: We can't go back to Fal Dara. Not yet.Rand: I'm not going back. I felt it. The madness. It's true, isn't it? What they say about men who can channel. That eventually they go so mad they kill everyone they've ever loved.Moiraine: It is.Rand: I have a favor to ask you. Just one. Tell them I died here. Tell them I didn't make it back.Moiraine: I cannot lie.Rand: You'll work out a way. You owe me that much.Moiraine: Where will you go?Rand: Goodbye, Moiraine.Fain: Today isn't the end. It's the beginning.: You thought he was defeated.: Ah, there you go. Tiniest push and you choose the Dark. Rand may be the Dragon, but all five of you have a part to play.: [footsteps approaching]Lan: You're alive. Where's Rand?Moiraine: He's gone.Lan: Unmask the bond. Let me back in.Moiraine: I can't. The Dark One. He... I can't touch the Source.: [sobs softly]Egwene: [sobbing] Nynaeve. Come back. [whispers] Come back.: [soft whooshing]: [coughing]: [Egwene sobbing]Moiraine: It's cuendillar.Lan: I thought that heartstone couldn't be scratched. That nothing, not even the One Power, could break it.Moiraine: So did I.Lan: What does it mean?Moiraine: That this wasn't the Last Battle. I fear it was the first.: [waves crashing]: [seabirds calling]: [humming a tune]: [humming stops]: [seabirds squawking]: [ships creaking]: [man shouts in foreign language]: [speaking foreign language in unison]
